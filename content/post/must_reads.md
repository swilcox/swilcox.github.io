# Things You Should be Reading
If you're not reading [Simon Willison's Weblog](https://simonwillison.net) then you're missing out. I was looking for something he'd posted and re-visiting his site, reminded me just how much content he's got. If you're not monitoring on a regular basis, seems like you're missing out.

The reason I was looking over the site was trying to remember the name of the super cool python debugging tool, [snoop](https://github.com/alexmojaki/snoop), that he'd written about. The quick win can be found early on in the `README.md` there, but just keep going. There's a ton there including some spooky trickery where you can [install](https://github.com/alexmojaki/snoop?tab=readme-ov-file#install) snoop into the running global namespace of your entire project. There's just a bunch of non-traditional python things going on under the hood. And of course, that's in addition to its usefulness.

And related to my [versions](/post/none_to_0_dot_1) post, Simon posted about [building CLI tools](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Sep/30/cli-tools-python/). There's *so* much here to chew on. It's some solid advice advice from someone with legit experience.

And then lately, or even not lately, he's been on top of it for awhile now, lots of talk about [ai](https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai/), his [LLM](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/) utility, and all things [LLMs](https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms/).
